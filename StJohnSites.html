            <div class="box"> <h2>Trunk Bay Beach</h2> <h2>Trunk bay is one of the tp 10 beaches in the world. It has white sand and very blue warm water. It is a must see beach while you are in St. John. Many cruise ships bring people here, so ask your air bnb host or hotel front desk when those ships viit or else the beach is very busy. Get there early as there is little parking. $10 cash for adults and free for children. </h2> </div>

            <div class="box"> <h2>Willy T's</h2> <h2>For years, it was one of the Caribbean's bucket-list bars: a floating, decommissioned old tanker converted into a beach bar Mecca. ... Then, in 2017, the William Thornton, or Willy T as it was affectionately known, was lost in Hurricane Irma. It was re-built in 2019 with the same name and floats in the same place as it did for many years! You can drive your boat up, but must check into the BVIs at customs first in Tortolla. </h2> </div>

            <div class="box"> <h2>The Lime Out</h2> <h2>is a floating taco boat located on the SouthEast side of Saint John in Coral Harbor.  The simple combination of tasty tacos + the salty sea make for the ‘best day ever.’ You do not need a boat to get here as you are able to rent kayaks on the beach and paddle out. The kayak rentals are cash only so make sure you bring cash and a credit card for the tacos and drinks!  </h2> </div>

            <div class="box"> <h2>Cinnamon Bay</h2> <h2> Cinnamon Bay is a beach located at the end of a strong of beaches on St. John. Althouogh it is furthest from town it is very popular because you are able to rent paddle boards, kayaks, snorkle gear and small sail boats right on the beach. Cinnamon bay has some of the best snorkling on the island and you will likely see a sea turtle and bright colored fish. </h2> </div>

            <div class="box"> <h2> Rams Head Trail</h2> <h2>
 
                Length: 2.3 miles out and back.
                Difficulty: Moderate. I don’t recommend bringing children, as trail has some steep drops.
                Time: 90 minutes on average.
                Terrain: Rocky soil, with a short section along a rock beach.
                Scenery: Beautiful turquoise water with views of St. John’s rocky South Shore and Salt Pond Beach. To the south, you can just make out St. Croix on the horizon.</h2> </div>

            <div class="box"> <h2>The Soggy Dollar</h2> <h2>The Soggy Dollar is my personal favorite. It is located on Jost Van Dike, BVIs but there is a boat yoou can take from St. John for a small fee. It is called the Soggy Dollar bar becuase there is no dock so to reach the beach where the bar is located, it is a common practice for boaters to anchor off the beach, swim to shore, and pay for their drinks with wet money. They are home to the famous drink "the painkiller".</h2> </div>
